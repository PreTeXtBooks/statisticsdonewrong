If you’re a practicing scientist, you probably use statistics to analyze
your data. From basic *t* tests and standard error calculations to Cox
proportional hazards models and propensity score matching, we rely on
statistics to give answers to scientific problems.

This is unfortunate, because statistical errors are rife.

*Statistics Done Wrong* is a guide to the most popular statistical
errors and slip-ups committed by scientists every day, in the lab and in
peer-reviewed journals. Many of the errors are prevalent in vast swaths
of the published literature, casting doubt on the findings of thousands
of papers. *Statistics Done Wrong* assumes no prior knowledge of
statistics, so you can read it before your first statistics course or
after thirty years of scientific practice.
